Problem Statement

Vehicles often face sudden breakdowns due to unnoticed issues like overheating, low oil level, battery failure, tire pressure drop, or fuel problems.
Drivers usually cannot identify these faults early, which leads to:

Unexpected breakdowns

High repair costs

Safety risks

Time loss during travel

There is no simple, unified system that continuously monitors vehicle health, detects faults automatically, and guides users with instant corrective actions.

💡 Proposed Solution

AutoMind is an intelligent self-healing vehicle system that uses sensor data (simulated or real) to monitor vehicle health in real time.
The system automatically:

Tracks key vehicle parameters

Detects abnormalities

Classifies issues (Normal / Warning / Critical)

Predicts possible failures

Provides self-healing guidance

A simple dashboard/app displays alerts, fault details, and recommended actions, helping the user understand and fix issues quickly.

⭐ Key Features

Real-time vehicle health monitoring

Automatic fault detection

Predictive maintenance alerts

Self-healing recommendations

Issue classification (Normal, Warning, Critical)

User-friendly dashboard for demo
